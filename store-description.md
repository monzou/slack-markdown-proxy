Slack Markdown Proxy automatically converts Markdown formatting when you paste text into Slack's message editor.

Slack uses its own rich text editor and doesn't support standard Markdown. This extension bridges the gap — just paste your Markdown and it gets converted to Slack's native formatting instantly.

Supported formatting:
- **Bold** — **text**
- *Italic* — *text*
- Links — [text](url)
- Bullet lists — - item
- Ordered lists — 1. item
- Blockquotes — > text
- Nested lists (indentation preserved)
- Nested inline formatting (e.g. italic links, bold links)

How it works:
1. Copy Markdown-formatted text from anywhere
2. Paste it into a Slack message input field
3. The extension automatically detects the Markdown and converts it to rich text

No configuration needed. No data is collected or sent anywhere — everything runs locally in your browser.
